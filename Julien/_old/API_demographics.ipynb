       "  'desc': 'The expanding global air network provides rapid and wide-reaching connections accelerating both domestic and international travel. To understand human movement patterns on the network and their socioeconomic, environmental and epidemiological implications, information on passenger flow is required. However, comprehensive data on global passenger flow remain difficult and expensive to obtain, prompting researchers and analysts to rely on scheduled flight seat capacity data or simple models of flow. WorldPop has developed models of global air passenger flows, with annual flow methods described in <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064317\"  target=\"_blank\">Huang et al</a>, seasonal flows described in <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692315001581\"  target=\"_blank\">Mao et al</a>, and the output estimates available to download here.'},\n",

The specifications of such data differ widely and therefore the harmonisation of data layers is a prerequisite to constructing detailed and contemporary spatial datasets which accurately describe population distributions. Such datasets are vital to measure impacts of population growth, monitor change, and plan interventions. To this end WorldPop has produced an open access archive of 3 and 30 arc-second resolution gridded data, which are available to download here and are described further in <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20964471.2019.1625151\"  target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al 2019</a> and also <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20171\"  target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al 2017</a>.'},\n",

These annual built-settlement maps were then used to inform the WorldPop \"Global per country 2000-2020\" population datasets.
